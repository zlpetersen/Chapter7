#### 0. Harmonic Mean
Write a program that takes in two integers as input and outputs the harmonic mean of the two numbers:
`
Enter two numbers (0 to quit): 1 4
Harmonic mean: 1.6
`
#### 1. Golf Scores
Write a program that asks for up to 10 golf scores, which are stored in an `array`. The program should then display all the scores on one line and report the average score.
#### 2. Box Volume
Create a program that has a `box` `struct` that contains a `name`, `width`, `length`, and `height`. It should take a `string` and three `int`s and calculate a volume based on these.
#### 3. Factorial
Write a program that takes in an `int` and calculates the `factorial` of it:
`
Enter an integer (non-numeric or negative to quit): 10
Factorial: 3.629e+06
`
#### 4. Reverse Array
Write a program that takes up to 10 `doubles` and puts them into an `array`. It should then reverse the `array` and display it:
`
Double 1: 5
Double 2: 4
Double 3: 3
Double 4: 2
Double 5: 1
Double 6: q
Original array:
Doubles:
5 4 3 2 1
Reversed array:
1 2 3 4 5
`
#### 5. Calculator
Create a program that takes two `int`s as input and performs operations on them:
`
Enter 2 numbers (non-numeric to quit): 5 4
5 + 4 = 9
5 - 4 = 1
5 * 4 = 20
5 / 4 = 1.25
`
